### Game Features
 ◦ Designed and built a semi-open world RPG spanning 5 unique biomes, each with distinct lighting, terrain, enemy
 encounters, and boss arenas using UE5’s Nanite landscapes and Quixel assets.  
 ◦ Engineered a collectible-based progression system where players gather Solar Hearts to unlock new areas and
 advance 9 years in-game, integrating lore via scattered notes and hidden quests.

 landscape streaming for future stability.  
 ◦ Currently developing an AI system featuring 10+ enemy archetypes, using Behavior Trees to implement
 patrol, chase, and attack logic.
