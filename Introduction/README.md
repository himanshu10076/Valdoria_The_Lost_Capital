# Valdoria - The Lost Capital

## Game Overview

**Valdoria - The Lost Capital** is an epic action RPG built in Unreal Engine 5, featuring immersive combat mechanics, stunning visuals, and a rich fantasy world waiting to be explored.

### Game Features
 ◦ Designed and built a semi-open world RPG spanning 5 unique biomes, each with distinct lighting, terrain, enemy
 encounters, and boss arenas using UE5’s Nanite landscapes and Quixel assets.  
 ◦ Engineered a collectible-based progression system where players gather Solar Hearts to unlock new areas and
 advance 9 years in-game, integrating lore via scattered notes and hidden quests.  
 ◦ Iteratively improved combat system architecture: transitioned from blueprint duplication → conditional logic →
 enums → gameplay tags, showcasing clean state-driven design with scalability in mind.  
 ◦ Achieved real-time performance of 30–45 FPS on mid-tier hardware; actively refining shaders, LODs, and
 landscape streaming for future stability.  
 ◦ Currently developing an AI system featuring 10+ enemy archetypes, using Behavior Trees to implement
 patrol, chase, and attack logic.
