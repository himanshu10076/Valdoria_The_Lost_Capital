## Current State Of The Game

### Details
- This folder contains all the foundational gameplay modules and assets for Valdoria in Unreal Engine 5, such as actors, AI logic, animation events, components, damage systems, enums, interfaces, structs, and user interface code. Each directory organizes the project's scripts and assets by their function, making it easy to manage complex gameplay systems, communication, and visual feedback.
- This structure lets developers rapidly build, update, and debug unique features by keeping related gameplay logic, asset types, and framework code separated for clarity and efficient workflow.

- **BP_Combat_Character**: This is the demo player where i have implemented all other functionality to that character engaging.  
- **Actors**: Contains all core in-game objects, such as interactive items like LightSword and Greatsword that can be placed or spawned in the level.
- **AI** : Stores artificial intelligence logic including enemy behavior, pathfinding blueprints, and behavior trees, Blackboard, AI controller and a Boss_Enemy which uses all these concepts.
- **AnimNotifies** : Holds animation notifications used to trigger in-game events (like Attach_Weapon, Collision_Trace, iFrames, Reset_Combat, Rotate_Character and Toggle_Combat) at precise points within animation sequences.
- **Components** : Includes reusable modular features (like State_Manager, Stats, Targetting, Collision and Combat Coponents) that can be attached to multiple actors to add functionality.
- **Damage Types** : Contains Stun and damage types like low and heavy.
- **Enums** : Stores enumerations that define a fixed set of named constants (such as movement states, weapon types, or AI statuses) for use in logic and blueprints.
- **Interfaces** : Contains blueprint or code interfaces used to establish consistent communication rules between different actors or components.
- **Structs and UI** : Structs Holds user-defined data structures organizing related variables (like player stats) for easy management and blueprint access whereas UI Contains user interface assets such as HUD elements, widgets, and interface blueprints for in-game displays and player interaction.

## Creation Of The First Map

### Implementation Overview
In the starting i created a small basic map which will lay out the foundation of this game's story and later into the characters movement mechanic. Everything Connects to Parhelion Tower.
