## Creation Of The First Map

### Implementation Overview
In the starting i created a small basic map which will lay out the foundation of this game's story and later into the characters movement mechanic. Everything Connects to Parhelion Tower.

## Combat Mechanics



### System Design
Implemented a comprehensive RPG-style character progression system featuring:

- **Health Points (HP)**: Player survivability
- **Mana Points (MP)**: Magical ability resource
- **Strength**: Physical damage modifier
- **Agility**: Movement speed and dodge effectiveness
- **Intelligence**: Magical damage and mana capacity

### Implementation Details
Created a custom Character Stats Component that handles:
- Stat calculation and modifiers
- Level-up progression curves
- UI integration for real-time display
- Save/load functionality for character persistence
